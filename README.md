# just-chat
A Pebble chat app - chat with other Pebble users!

Ideas:
1. More message types: Emojis, PDCs, other fun media
2. Allow users to claim a username which is linked to their Rebble token (would be done in the config page)
3. Allow for friends / direct message abilities
4. User entered / exited messages


Needs: 
1. Message memory management
2. Make config page to allow users some configuration such as: vibes, confirm dictation

Notes: 
1. There is no chat history and I don't intend to implement one
2. Current username is first four characters of the user's Rebble token
